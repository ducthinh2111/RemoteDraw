# Remote Draw Application
# Definition
The drawing board provides users abilities to customise their drawings; we could find some applications such as Windows Paint, Artweaver, GIMP, etc. However, these programs only available for one user at a time. <b>Remote Draw</b> can allow multiple users to draw on board simultaneously through the network, which helps users spread their idea to other people more comfortable.
