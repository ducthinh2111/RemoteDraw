# Remote Draw Application
Project Description
# Definition
The drawing board provides users abilities to customize their drawings; we could find out some applications such as Windows Paint, Artweaver, GIMPâ€¦ However, these programs only available for one user at the time. 
We are in need of creating an application that can allow multiple users to draw on board simultaneously through a local network like cable connection, Wifi, or Bluetooth. 
This application must meet some technical requirements:
 - Programming language: Java
 - Framework: JavaSDK 11, JavaFX 13
 - Platform: Multiplatform
